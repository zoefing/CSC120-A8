Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I made a very simple game that uses user input to drive the player's decisions. I added an inventory method and a show options method. I struggled to decide what to do with some methods, especially undo. I had a vision of what I wanted to do (wipe the console) and had to compromise and take a more simplistic approach (pretending to wipe the console). I did not wish to unnecessarily complicate my code in a way that would lead to a slew of errors later on.

Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun brainstorming ideas for the other methods. I look forward to working on my final project, especially now that I've messed around with a user-input-based text game. My advice for this one is to have fun!
